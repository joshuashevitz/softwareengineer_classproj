This is the repository for our group's semester-long web development project.

# TO-DO
- Create the homepage (index.html/js)
    - **Get it on [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) as soon as possible!**
- Establish a site color scheme and overall design, probably using [Figma](https://figma.com)
    - Ideally a CSS file with variables for primary/secondary colors, stuff like that, so we can just import and use those styles in whatever we need to
- Create other pages:
    - Register
    - Log in
    - Game access point (to go to Offline or Online play)
